# React Weather App

### [Link To Live Deployment on Heroku](https://react-weather-hooks.herokuapp.com/)

A simple react weather app that saves up to 20 locations. Styled with Material-Ui library.

Uses the Open Weather Map API. Locations are saved in local storage.

Register for API key in https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys


The requests to Open Weather Map's API is done through the server (for good practice to avoid exposing the API key).

- git clone `git@github.com:samokasha/react-weather-hooks.git`

- Export object with key/value `OWM_KEY:"YOUR_API_KEY"` in `config/dev.js`.

- `npm run dev to run` in development.

- Configured to deploy on Heroku.
